## Inspiration
**The project is inspired by the need to reduce the amount of perfectly functioning parts on used furniture on its way to the landfill. This way, we reduce the amount of waste that is generated from the disposal of furniture. We should all strive to reduce the amount of waste that we produce. **

## What it does
The program calculates the lowest cost option to build a desired type of furniture. Currently, the program can take in the client request and calculate a furniture combination for furniture in the lamp category. 

## How we built it
We built our application using the Java programming language and its standard libraries. The program also queries and alters the inventory database, which is stored in a MySQL file. 

## Challenges we ran into
The algorithm to determine all the possible combinations of furniture pieces to fulfill an order has been challenging. This is in-part because the lowest cost option out of all possible options has to be considered. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the order request interface. The command-line interface ensures that we properly receive order requests that are complete and valid.

## What we learned
We learned that it is important to make sure that our program aims to solve the original problem statement. For example, we should make sure that we aim to make the most out of  **all** functional parts from the inventory's furniture. This way, we reduce landfill waste.

## What's next for Faculty FrankenFurniture Finder
Next, we plan to implement the algorithm that determines the lowest cost for an order with any desired furniture from our inventory.
